# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add separate Check-in and Check-out submission flows (in addition to Daily Activities), with all submission timestamps generated by the backend, and rename the “QPC” activity label to “Qur’anic Parenting Center”.

**Planned changes:**
- Add backend support for storing Check-in submissions separately from Daily Activities, using a server-generated timestamp at submit time.
- Add backend support for storing Check-out submissions separately from Daily Activities, using a server-generated timestamp at submit time.
- Update existing Daily Activity submission logic to store a backend-generated server timestamp at submit time.
- Add Principal-facing navigation/routes for three distinct submit flows: Check-in, Daily Activities, and Check-out, each with its own submit action and feedback.
- Update all user-facing UI labels from “QPC” to “Qur’anic Parenting Center” without changing KPI scoring/weighting behavior.

**User-visible outcome:** Principals can submit Check-in, Daily Activities, and Check-out in three separate flows, and see server-timestamped records; admin roles can view check-in/out across principals per existing access patterns; the activity label displays “Qur’anic Parenting Center” instead of “QPC”.
